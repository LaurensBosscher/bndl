Welcome to the BNDL documentation!
==================================

BNDL is a python library for map-reduce based distributed processing akin to Apache Spark.

The key module for users to interact with BNDL is ``bndl.compute``. This module provides
operators for distributed (partitioned) datasets. Once you get BNDL up and running,
:doc:`/usage/compute/index` is the main area of these docs to read.
