Dashboard
=========

BNDL hosts a modest dashboard from the driver. It is accessible at port 8080 (or a higher port
below 8100 if 8080 is not available), i.e.: `<http://localhost:8080/>`_.

The dashboard is build up out of modules; one for ``bndl.net`` and ``bndl.compute`` are available by
default. Others may be added by plugins, e.g. ``bndl_cassandra``.
